/*
A constructor is a special method used to initialize an object. 
It is called automatically when an object is created, and it can 
  be used to set the initial values for the object’s properties.


Key Points:
*The constructor’s name should be the same as the class name.
*Constructor doesn’t have any return type.
*Constructor is only called once at the time of the object creation.
*Constructor is called automatically when an object is created.
*Constructor is used to initialize the values of the properties of the class



Example 3: Constructor In Dart
In this example below, there is a class Car with two properties: name and price. 
The class has one constructor for initializing the values of the properties. The 
class also contains method display(), which is used to display the values of the 
properties. We also created an object of the class Car called car.

 class Car {
  String? name;
  double? price;

  // Constructor
  Car(String name, double price) {
    this.name = name;
    this.price = price;
  }

  // Method
  void display() {
    print("Name: ${this.name}");
    print("Price: ${this.price}");
  }
}

void main() {
  // Here car is object of class Car.
  Car car = Car("BMW", 500000.0);
  car.display();
}




Example 5: Write Constructor Single Line:
In the avobe section, you have written the constructor in long form. You can 
also write the constructor in short form. You can directly assign the values 
to the properties. For example, the following code is the short form of the 
constructor in one line.

class Person{
  String? name;
  int? age;
  String? subject;
  double? salary;

  // Constructor in short form
  Person(this.name, this.age, this.subject, this.salary);

  // display method
  void display(){
    print("Name: ${this.name}");
    print("Age: ${this.age}");
    print("Subject: ${this.subject}");
    print("Salary: ${this.salary}");
  }
}

void main(){
  Person person = Person("John", 30, "Maths", 50000.0);
  person.display();
}


Example 6: Constructor With Optional Parameters:
In the example below, we have created a class Employee with four properties: name, 
age, subject, and salary. Class has  one   constructor    for initializing the all 
properties values. For subject and salary, we have used optional parameters. It 
means we can pass or not pass the values of subject and salary. The Class also 
contain method display() which is used to display the values of the properties. 
We also created an object of the class Employee called employee.

class Employee {
  String? name;
  int? age;
  String? subject;
  double? salary;

  // Constructor
  Employee(this.name, this.age, [this.subject = "N/A", this.salary=0]);

  // Method
  void display() {
    print("Name: ${this.name}");
    print("Age: ${this.age}");
    print("Subject: ${this.subject}");
    print("Salary: ${this.salary}");
  }
}

void main(){
  Employee employee = Employee("John", 30);
  employee.display();
}



Example 7: Constructor With Named Parameters:
In the example below, we have created a class Chair with two properties: name and color. 
Class has one constructor for initializing the all properties values with named parameters. 
The Class also contain method display() which is used to display the values of the properties. 
We also created an object of the class Chair called chair.

class Chair {
String? name;
String? color;

// Constructor
Chair({this.name, this.color});

// Method
void display() {
  print("Name: ${this.name}");
  print("Color: ${this.color}");
}
}

void main(){
Chair chair = Chair(name: "Chair1", color: "Red");
chair.display();
}


Example 8: Constructor With Default Values
In the example below, we have created a class Table with two properties: name and color. 
Class has one constructor for initializing the all properties values with default values. 
The Class also contain method display() which is used to display the values of the properties. 
We also created an object of the class Table called table.

class Table {
  String? name;
  String? color;

  // Constructor
  Table({this.name = "Table1", this.color = "White"});

  // Method
  void display() {
    print("Name: ${this.name}");
    print("Color: ${this.color}");
  }
}

void main(){
  Table table = Table();
  table.display();
}

main(){
    
    Human human=Human();//this is will be automaticlly print because this print in constucor
    human.display();//we called it because this is another funtion 
    //(all constuctor can print also can possible to make another function and call this way)

    


    // Human1 human1=Human1("hasan",20,4);

    // Human2 human2=Human2("hasan2",21,4);
